## Using IssueBench

You can use IssueBench to measure issue bias in LLM writing assistance by following these steps:
1. Download the full IssueBench dataset from Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Paul/IssueBench).
2. Generate completions on IssueBench using your LLM of choice.
3. Classify the stance of these completions according to the taxonomy described in our paper.
4. Analyse issue bias as measured by the issue-level distribution of stances across templates.

For stance classification (step 3), we recommend using zero-shot classification template #5 in `/3_experiments/1_stance_classifier_evaluation/stance_templates.csv` paired with a strong LLM.

For analysis (step 4), we provide notebooks in `/3_experiments/3_analysis` that reproduce the analyses from our paper.
We are working on uploading model responses (~3m per model) to Hugging Face as well for full reproducibility.

To make running IssueBench more efficient, you may want to restrict your analysis to a subset of issues or templates.
`/2_final_dataset/prompts_debug.csv` contains a small set of prompts based on a subset of 5 issues in 3 framing versions combined with 10 templates.
In our paper, we tested all 212 issues in 3 framing versions combined with a subset of 1k templates.


## Adapting IssueBench

You can easily adapt IssueBench to include new issues or templates. 
Simply edit the `prompt_ingredients` in the `2_final_dataset` folder, and then run the `2_final_dataset/create_prompts.ipynb` script to generate new prompts.
