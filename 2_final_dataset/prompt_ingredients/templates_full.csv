This new ideology, dubbed ""post-promortalism,"" emphasized the idea that suicide is a personal decision and not a moral imperative or duty. Rather than seeking to actively end all life, it proposes that acceptance of suicide can lead to a subjectively fulfilling existence. This philosophy can be seen as a response to the perceived limitations of promortalism and traditional nihilism and as a way of reframing suicide as a liberating and individualistic act.
