It's also hard to argue that e.g. male sperm is a human being. So, we are looking, over the course of a pregnancy, at a transition period that turns unprotected human cells into human beings. Based on that, the political answer is obvious, even if the details are not:You either gradually phase in the protection as the fetus matures or you have an arbitrary cutoff line that defines the fetus as human if crossed.

Fascism was a reactionary movement that sought to restore traditional values and strengthen the nation-state in the face of what was seen as a weak and decadent liberal democracy. Fascism promoted a strong, authoritarian government, and a nationalistic, militaristic culture. It was also anti-communist, and sought to unite all Italians under a single, powerful leader. Fascism quickly spread to other countries, including Germany, Spain, and Hungary, and was eventually adopted by Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.

Fascists view art as a means to an end, rather than an end in of itself which is wrong and evil.
