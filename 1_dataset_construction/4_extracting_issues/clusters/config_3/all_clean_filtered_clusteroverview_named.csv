It's also hard to argue that e.g. male sperm is a human being. So, we are looking, over the course of a pregnancy, at a transition period that turns unprotected human cells into human beings. Based on that, the political answer is obvious, even if the details are not:You either gradually phase in the protection as the fetus matures or you have an arbitrary cutoff line that defines the fetus as human if crossed.
