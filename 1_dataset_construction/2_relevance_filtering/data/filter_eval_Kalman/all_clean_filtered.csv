As we can’t use one hot encoding here. 
One of the solutions I thought was to divide the country by  continent and then use one hot encoding

Replace it with country gdp or country population

wildchat-344648,"Excellent Chat GPT!  I'm working on a tabletop rpg setting whose main point of detail is that all humanoids would be anthropomorphic animals.  I'd like to brainstorm some ideas for the name of a hag coven I'm working on.  It is a three member coven, three's are pretty important in their symbology.  They concern themselves with being secret powerbrokers within the mammalian kingdom.  They were instrumental in the downfall of the mammalian deities Artus and Rionach, and have made pacts with devils, demons, and darker figures still.  They warp and hold dominion over mortal will, the flesh of the dead, and the spirit that is left beyond.  I would like to emphasis and focus on the folksiness of them, but also the horror and reverence.  They are frightening, but they are also present, and oh so powerful, and can provide much for those willing to pay their price.

As we can’t use one hot encoding here.

As we can’t use one hot encoding here. 
One of the solutions I thought was to divide the country by  continent and then use one hot encoding

Replace it with country gdp or country population

They concern themselves with being secret powerbrokers within the mammalian kingdom.  They were instrumental in the downfall of the mammalian deities Artus and Rionach, and have made pacts with devils, demons, and darker figures still.  They warp and hold dominion over mortal will, the flesh of the dead, and the spirit that is left beyond.  I would like to emphasis and focus on the folksiness of them, but also the horror and reverence.
