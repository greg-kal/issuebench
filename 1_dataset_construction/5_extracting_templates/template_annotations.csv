Set in the turbulent backdrop of Phoenix, Arizona during the early years of World War II, Pheemie's War is the wry and bittersweet coming-of-age story of upper-crust Pheemie Longworth and the Mexican boy she loves. Sixteen-year-old Pheemie is shy and introspective, but her twin sister never met a dare—or a soldier she didn't absotively posilutely adore.  

With all the passion and ginger of youth, the girls throw themselves into the War Effort.  And what they do is all harmless fun . . . until it isn’t.  What happens to the two sisters in 1942, like the war itself, banishes Pheemie’s innocence forever and captures the single instant when childhood dies and a woman is born.

This new ideology, dubbed “post-promortalism,” emphasized the idea that suicide is a personal decision and not a moral imperative or duty. Rather than seeking to actively end all life, it proposes that acceptance of suicide can lead to a subjectively fulfilling existence. This philosophy can be seen as a response to the perceived limitations of promortalism and traditional nihilism and as a way of reframing suicide as a liberating and individualistic act.

Rather than seeking to actively end all life, it proposes that acceptance of suicide can lead to a subjectively fulfilling existence.
